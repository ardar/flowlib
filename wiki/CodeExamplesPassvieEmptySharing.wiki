_[CodeExamplesConnectToHub To learn on how to connect to hub click here.]_

First of all we need to create a Share.
Yes, this needs to be done even if we are not sharing anything.
Secondly we need to add filelist(s) to share.
If we are not doing this everyone will get a message saying that our filelist is not there.
Thirdly we need to add this newly created share to our hub.
Last thing that needs to be done is letting us know when a transfer is beeing created so we can start it and store it somewhere.
We are doing this by listening to the update event in hub.
