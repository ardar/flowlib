  _[Todo See Todo for changes still remaining before release]_


  * *Changes from TODO:*
  * UPnP Support (Rewritten and implemented small parts of my UPnPSharp library to fit FlowLib)
  * Statistics support (Show how much of X traffic that has been transferred and what kind of traffic. You will of course be able to declare your own matching objects.)
  * Connection detection (Code comes from Xmpl). It will make it possible to determine what type of connection user can get without setting some firewall rules up (None, Passive, Active through UPnP, Active).




  * *Other changes:*
  * ADD		- Dispose function for TcpConnection and Hub. Disconnects and cleans resources. (You should call this if you dont want hub to reconnect or if you dont want to use the hub object anymore)
    * IsDisposed shows if object has been disposed or not.
    * IsDisposing shows if object is about to be disposed (can be read on ConnectionStatusChange event).
  * FIX		- bug where TcpConnectionListener would throw an objectdisposed exception when calling Start.
  * FIX		- bug where PM would be identified as MainChat message (ADC only).
  * FIX		- bug where Userlist wouldnt be cleared when disconnected from hub.
  * FIX		- bug where hub tried to send/update UserInfo(INF/MyINFO) when connection to hub was not usable.
  * CHANGE	- Nmdc implementation so it is more like Adc implementation. When you send a PM you will receive the same message from hub. *(OBS! This may break your implementation)*
  * ADD/FIX	- (Adc Only) Compare of last INF sent and the one we want to send now and creates a new INF that just have the parts that has been changed. This saves bandwidth and fix so you are not disconnected from some adc hubs (some hubs dont allow sending CID more then once) (Thanks to FleetCommand who pointed me in the right direction).
    * Example:
      * LAST INF:BINF GQEH IDZE4ZCKFL5KEX7H7AXQW2Q7BCVLRG4AODPWJHP5Q PDAOY7W7NO2CEFQVEPQDIAP7UNNMI6L6VQSZPJY3I DE HN0 HO0 HR0 NIXmpl-633523558744590000 SL2 SF0 SS0 VEXmple\sV:20080720
      * Current INF:BINF GQEH IDZE4ZCKFL5KEX7H7AXQW2Q7BCVLRG4AODPWJHP5Q PDAOY7W7NO2CEFQVEPQDIAP7UNNMI6L6VQSZPJY3I DE HN1 HO0 HR0 NIXmpl-633523558744590000 SL2 SF0 SS0 VEXmple\sV:20080720
      * Will give this new INF: BINF GQEH HN1
  * FIX		- Encoding problem when protocol was set to Auto. Thanks to arctic.bot for reporting. [http://code.google.com/p/flowlib/issues/detail?id=11 Issue 11]
  * ADD		- Token in SearchResultInfo (For Adc)
  * CHANGE/FIX		- We are now using codepage 1252 for encoding Nmdc messages (We used system default before. *This may break your implementation*). This means you need to have _codepage 1252_ installed to have Nmdc connection working (make sure you have _libmono-i18n2.0-cil_ installed if you are running Ubuntu+Mono)
  * ADD		- Converting hub settings to/from Xmpl client (http://code.google.com/p/xmpl/)
  * FIX		- SegmentStarted event was not trigged for filelists and files with unknown size. Thanks hackward for reporting. [http://code.google.com/p/flowlib/issues/detail?id=14 Issue 14].
  * CHANGE		- Encoding for protocols can now be set. Thanks hackward for reporting [http://code.google.com/p/flowlib/issues/detail?id=15 Issue 15].
  * FIX		- Bug that made hub count wrong if you was just connected to one ADC hub. Thanks Spookie for reporting.
  * FIX		- Bug that made active searches to send wrong ip to hub.
  * FIX		- ADC search results now includes TTH if available.
  * CHANGE		- All unknown params in search results are now stored so developer can add support for it even if FlowLib doesn't support it yet. (ADC only)
  * FIX		- Bug where search and search results wasn't converted to right format. (ADC Only)
  * CHANGE		- FlowSortedList
    # Now returns position when a item is added/removed from list.
    # Added Events for adding, removing and sorting items.
    # Changed Access level for variables and methods from private to protected.
    # Changed public Find method so it now uses the Comparer object to determine if it is the same object or not.
  * FIX		- Bug where we used direct instead of echo messages for Private messages in ADC.
  * FIX		- Bug that made tag not being updated with registered and above hub count (ADC Only). Thanks Spookie for reporting.
  * FIX		- Fixed so RCM was sent correctly in ADC. Thanks fadil.khodabuccus for reporting [http://code.google.com/p/flowlib/issues/detail?id=16 Issue 16]
  * FIX		- Bug that made it impossible to parse protocol version on some systems. Thanks fadil.khodabuccus for reporting [http://code.google.com/p/flowlib/issues/detail?id=17 Issue 17]
  * ADD		- EndPoint property to UdpConnection and made properties protected instead of private.
  * CHANGE		- IConnection and IProtocols now implements System.IDisposable and a property called IsDisposed (All objects using them already had them implemented).

      * Supports a modified version of $ConnectToMe and $MyINFO. (Special thanks to PPK who came up with the idea from the begining)
            * {{{$ConnectToMe <RemoteNick> <SenderIp>:<SenderTLSPort>[S]|}}} S indicate secure connection and should only be sent from user a if user b also supports TLS, this is indicated in $MyINFO.
            * {{{$MyINFO $ALL <nick> <description>$ $<connection><flag>$<e-mail>$<sharesize>$|}}} flag value of: {{{0x10 = TLS (0x10 hex == 16 dec)}}} indicates support for tls
