= Details =

FlowLib currently has an annoying bug which occurs when downloading files from a user. Sometimes (For me it seems random) FlowLib is switching to command mode when it should be receiving data.

This seems to happen for both ADC and NMDC protocols. This seems to be a general error in handling. It also seems to occur around the GET and SND commands.

If you find this bug please let me know ASAP
