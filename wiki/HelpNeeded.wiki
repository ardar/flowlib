= Details =

FlowLib currently have a annoying bug occurring when downloading files from a user.
Sometimes (For me it seems random) FlowLib is switching to command mode when it should be receiving data.

This seem to happen for both ADC and NMDC so it seem to be a general error in handling.
It also seem to occur around the *GET* and *SND* commands.

If you find this bug please let me know
