YnHub 1.036 Changelog.

Fixed: 
* 'Invalid stream format' error.
* Issue with MC/PM scanner that was happening because of the previous error.

New:
* MCTo: Changed this so that anything that doesn't start with $ is valid, instead of just <
  since we might want to send "*** Hello" and not just "<bot> Hello".
* Added Feed for invalid MCTo's.
* Updated the included textcommands to showcase new features.


Note:
This is a fix of 1.035. For further changes see the 1.035 changelog.
